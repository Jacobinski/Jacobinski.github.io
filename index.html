        <h4 class="position">Software Engineer - Site Reliability</h4>
        <p>My work at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> has not yet started. Check back in September! </p>

        <h3 class="company">Garmin</h3>
        <h4 class="position">Software Engineer Intern</h4>
        My work at <a href="https://www.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> focused on the development of power-saving algorithms and machine learning models for the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-CA/CA/p/605172">Approach CT10</a>. 
        In summary, my position consisted of:
        <ul>
            <li>Designed, implemented, and trained a machine learning algorithm to classify time series events.</li>
            <li>Implemented a power management state machine which varies system power based on acceleration events.</li>
            <li>Created Python scripts that parsed CSV logs for system diagnostics and testing.</li>
            <li>Developed device drivers in C, C++.</li>
            <li>Tested and debugged software using device probes such as the Segger J-Link.</li>
            <li>Profiled code run times with logic analyzers.</li>
        </ul>
        This is a picture of the Approach CT10 which I worked on during my internship.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        All of my side projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Jacobinski">GitHub</a> page. 
        Here are a few of the projects that I feel are worth sharing on this portfolio.

        <h3>Command Line Minesweeper</h3>
        <p> This project was used to practice creating a terminal application which had an interface that was navigatable
        using the arrow keys. Minesweeper was a natural choice for the logic of this game as it has a simple set of rules
        and makes heavy use of the arrow keys and terminal colors. </p>

        <p>This project was created using Python 3 and heavily relies on the ncurses library, which comes preinstalled with Python.</p>
